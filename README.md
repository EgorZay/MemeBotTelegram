# MemeBotTelegram
### Telegram bot to provide you with memes when you feel exhausted
#### Available commands:

~~ /meme or /Meme to post memes

~~ /kappa or /Kappa to post Kappa Emoticon

~~ Added Inline Handler to post Kappas via '@MemesMasterBot Kappa'

Why post Kappa via @memer_bot? Well, I am too lazy to drag my mouse over to Emote pack, ya know...

This bot is created with the infamous '[pyTelegramBotAPI](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI) library.

To let it work create a folder with config.py and memer_bot.py at the same directory. Reconfigure config.token with the appropriate token obtained from @FatherBot at Telegram. To receive your token, type /newbot in the @FatherBot chat. After having added the token to config.py launch memer_bot.py and (optional) get excited.

### UPD Section

Folder **bot_v1.1** contains a memer_bot.py version that parses top-60 frontpage imgur images and gifs!

For simplicity, .exe format is placed in /build branch.

Thanks.
